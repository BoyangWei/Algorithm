This experiment aims to verify the Birthday Problem and the Coupon Collector's Problem. These are both relevant to
understanding how a hash table, especially one using separate chaining, will behave. But scientists, including engineers, 
shouldn't always just take things for granted. So, you will actually run experiments to validate the following two expressions:
C1(m) is close to √(π×m/2) and B0(m) is very close to m×lnm
  where
m is the number of bins/slots; and
C1(m) is the (average) number of hashes/throws before the first collision in encountered; and
B0(m) is the (average) number of hashes/throws before all bins/slots are filled (i.e. there are zero empty bins).
